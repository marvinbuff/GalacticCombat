== Game Design

=== Tower

A tower can be bought in the shop with gold, placed onto the field, and will then shoot incoming invaders.

==== Details

|===
| Tower          | Range  | Frequency | Turret Speed | Bullet

|===

Properties::
- View
- Price
- Range
- Frequency
- Turret Speed
- Targeting Strategy (Foremost, High Health, Effect Not Yet Applied)

Scaling::
- Level 1-3 give around 10% of extra damage per level, with an extra 5% of utility.
- Level 4 allows to take a specialization, with 15% utility increase.
- Level 5 is the final upgrade.
It costs more and gives a massive stat boost.
- Overview: 100% + 15% + 15% + 15% + 15% + 40%

Upgrade Ideas::
* General
** AOE Variant
** Quicker Reload
** Faster Turret Speed
** More Range
* Cannon Tower (more damage/penetration)
**  ?
* Spore Launcher (higher dot)
** Poison Cloud (static cloud applying dots once per entity for x seconds)
** Lethal Poison (Less ticks, same damage)
* Tactical Tower (more damage/penetration)
** Penetrates Obstacles
** Armour Shred
** High Caliber (more range, more delay, more damage, more penetration)

=== Bullet

Bullets consist of the following parts:

- View
- Speed
- Target

=== Invader

A list of all planned and implemented invaders with their stats.

|===
| Invader | Health Points | Armour | Speed | Speciality
| Armoured | 100 HP | 8 AC | Slow | -
| Balanced | 100 HP | 2 AC | Normal | -
| Overclocked | 80 HP | 0 AC | Fast | -

| Generals | Health Points | Armour | Speed | Speciality
| Red Square | 1000 HP | 4 AC | Slow | -
| The Bastion | 1000 HP| 30 AC | Very Slow | Stops to regenerate

|===

==== Details

Levels::
Each invader has comes in variations for Level 1 - 3. A level up increases the health, armour, and special effects of an invader.

Scaling::
* Level 1-3: 41.2% improvement per level -> 100 to 141 to 200

Properties::
- Health
- Armour
- Speed
- Type (defines traits)
- Level (defines scaling)

Traits::
- Healing - aoe range, amount, self-flag
- Regenerating - amount, delay
- Dashing - speed boost, cooldown, duration
- Shielded - amount, regeneration amount, regeneration delay (prevents effects, ignores armour and penetration, regenerates)
- Covered - physical shield
- Disrupting - aoe range
- Spawning - child, frequency

=== Game Variables

The game holds various variables which are either kept between waves, levels, or instances.

Health:: Health is reduced by invaders reaching the goal and on zero health, the game is over.
Gold:: Gold is earned passively and allows the player to buy towers.
Experience:: Destroying an invader grants experience, which can be used to level up towers.
Score:: The score is a metric to measure how efficiently a player has beaten a level.
You gain points over time, by destroying invaders, and from any unspent resource at the end of a level.

=== Level

TODO::
* what is the information sufficient to describe a level (background, path, spawner, enabled towers, start money, etc.)
* list of levels

==== Details

Each level contains a list of Entities to spawn on load:

* LevelData
* WaveTimer

* Title
* Description
* Difficulty Rating
* A set of Way Points
* A set of Waves, each wave having
** as set of mappings from time to Invader

Future Ides:

* (The trickle gold depends on the level)
* (Environment objects, which are just entities marked by a time.)
* (Randomness)

=== Miscellaneous

==== Way Points

TODO (different routes?)

==== Armour

To add more depth to the interaction between towers and invaders, we introduce Armour.

Armour:: Invaders have armour which reduce the damage of each incoming bullet.
Having `x` armour lowers incoming damage by `x` for each bullet.
Armour Penetration:: Towers can shoot bullets which penetrate the invaders armour, effectively ignoring it.
Having `x` penetration and hitting an invader with `y` armour, will do damage as if the invader only had `y-x` armour.

== Future Ideas

Some notes and ideas I had to improve GC in the future.

=== Mobile Defenses

A cool idea would be to have mobile "Towers".
They would function the same in regards to effects, range and other interaction with invaders.
However they would look like spaceships and could be commanded to move somewhere by the player.
They would then circle around the position and shoot everything in range.
Until the players commands them to move somewhere else.

Pro::
- More interaction with the player than regular towers.
- Very easy to implement.
Can use the base tower and just enable some moving patter and interaction with the player.

Con::
- Might add a lot of clutter, with ships overlapping towers, invaders, etc.
- Requires new assets.
(Although might use Space Wars ones.)
- Mobility is not that important in late game, neutralizing the improvement.

=== Random Levels

An interesting option would be to have levels which are not fully determined.
For example, we define that there are three waves until the general appears, but the exact composition of the waves is randomly determined.
This would make it harder to find one easy way to beat a level as you have to prepare for multiple events.

Pro::
- Could be a very interesting alternative to the scripted levels
- Might be used as an addition.
For example, it could be interesting to have single waves which are random.

Con::
- Difficult to include in a level file.
- Inconsistent level difficulty could lessen the pride gained from beating a level.
